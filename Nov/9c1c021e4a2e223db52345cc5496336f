SYDNEY, Nov 24 – Australian businessman Clive Palmer said on Friday the Supreme Court of Western Australia awarded his company about A$200 million ($152 million) in damages in a dispute with Chinese conglomerate CITIC. Palmer’s Mineralogy claimed it is owed money by CITIC’s Sino
Iron mine in Western Australia over a failure to agree to a
formula for calculating the value of the ore extracted at the
site following a shift in pricing in the iron ore market. A spokesman for CITIC, which has been in legal disputes with
Mineralogy over royalties, told Reuters the company will
“carefully review the judgement and its implication for Sino
Iron.” Justice Kenneth Martin ruled that CITIC’s wholly owned
subsidiaries Sino Iron and Korean Steel pay Mineralogy the
damages, Palmer said in a press release. In addition to the payment for damages, CITIC is also
ordered to pay Mineralogy A$200 million in royalties annually
for the next 30 years, according to the statement. A court spokesman did not immediately answer phone calls. “This is a win for Australian law over Chinese Communist
Government powerhouses who have wasted precious court time,
resources and energy,” Palmer said. “For too long they have used
their power to try and crush Australian enterprise and
thankfully today justice has been served.” CITIC warned in August it may suspend operations at its Sino
Iron mine in Western Australia if it cannot resolve legal
disputes with Mineralogy. ($1 = 1.3137 Australian dollars) -(Reuters)
