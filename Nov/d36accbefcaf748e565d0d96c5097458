Zimbabweâ€™s military chief Constantino Chiwenga on Tuesday (November 21) urged restraint across all political parties after Robert Mugabe resigned as president. Chiwengo made a statement from Defence forces headquarters in Harare, urging all of Zimbabwean society to exercise restraint while observing law and order. Mugabe resigned a week after the army and his former political allies moved to end an era of rule by a man once feted as a hero, who led his country to independence from Britain in 1980. But nearly four decades later, he was regarded by many as an autocrat, willing to unleash death squads, rig elections and trash the economy in the relentless pursuit of power. The 93-year-old clung to power despite his own party ZANU-PF urging him to go. Mugabe finally resigned moments after parliament began an impeachment process seen as the only legal way to force him out. Reuters
