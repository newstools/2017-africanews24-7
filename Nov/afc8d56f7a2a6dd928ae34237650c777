Amr Fahmy was appointed as the new
general secretary of the Confederation of African Football
(CAF), keeping up a family tradition that stretches across three
generations. The 34-year-old Egyptian replaces Hicham El Amrani of
Morocco, who resigned just weeks after long-standing president
Issa Hayatou of Cameroon was ousted in a surprise election
defeat to Ahmad of Madagascar in March. Fahmy’s grandfather Mourad served as general secretary of
African football’s governing body from 1961-82, after which he
was replaced by his son Mustapha, who held the post until 2010
before moving to Zurich as the director of competitions at FIFA. Amr Fahmy would be assisted by former Ghana international
Tony Baffoe, who has been appointed deputy general secretary in
charge of development and competitions, while Essadik Alaoui of
Morocco had also been appointed deputy general secretary in
charge of administration and finance, a CAF statement said.
