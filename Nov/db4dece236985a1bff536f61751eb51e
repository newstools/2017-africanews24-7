Chris Mutsvangwa said “there is no going back, he must leave” adding Mugabe wanting to hand power to his wife, Grace, to create a dynasty was “sheer madness.”Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe appeared in public on Friday for the first time since the army took charge this week, as the ruling party made plans to force him to step down after more than three decades in power.The president, who is 93, opened a graduation ceremony at Zimbabwe Open University in Harare. He wore blue and yellow academic robes and a mortar board hat and appeared to fall asleep in his chair as his eyes closed and his head lolled. 4
