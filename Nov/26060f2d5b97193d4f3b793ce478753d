STORY: Kenya’s opposition leader Raila Odinga blamed President Uhuru Kenyatta for the “barbaric” violence that took place in Nairobi on Friday (November 17). Kenya’s police service said five people were killed by mobs on Friday for looting during “unauthorised” processions called to welcome Odinga back to the country after a trip abroad. They fired tear gas at Odinga’s convoy and used water cannon as they tried to stop it from reaching the capital’s main business district. Some protesters threw stones at police.Reuters photographers had earlier counted two bodies with gunshot wounds sustained in the violence as police tried to disperse Odinga’s supporters who walked alongside his convoy from the airport. Odinga has called for a “National Resistance Movement” to protest against the outcome of a repeat presidential election last month which saw Kenyatta win a second, five-year term with 98 percent of the vote after Odinga boycotted the contest. Only 39 percent of registered voters took part. The repeat poll was ordered by the Supreme Court after it annulled the results of the August election, won by Kenyatta, over procedural irregularities. The court will rule on Monday (November 20) on cases that seek to nullify the rerun election.
