First, we must revisit our assumption of how the glutes are engaged. Everyone in the fitness industry is working glutes like a muscle, yet the real bio mechanics of how glutes are engaged is through the fascia, and the only body part that can engage the glutes is the feet (through fascia nerves), not dead-lift or squat. Due to brain plasticity, the body utilizes the glutes the same way every single time, if a person is quad dominant, during deadlift or squat, it’s not going to engage glutes no matter how hard you try. In order to deliver a tremendous amount of force, the feet have to be extremely “strong” and if you examine the property of feet you will find that the feet are composed by fascia and extremely high amount of nerves endings, 200,000. Also, it has the property of plasticity, meaning deform under high pressure over a period of time. The feet have to be able to transfer the signal of the “force” to the glutes through fascia nerves. Naturally, running barefoot since a young age, think of toddlers on different rough terrain will morph the feet over time into what is called the Hyperarch mode, triggers the Hyperarch mechanism expression making the individual glutes dominant and fascia compliant over time. Bolt is able to do this because: 1) he ran barefoot when he was young for many years,
2) he was able to trigger the Hyperarch mechanism to fire and morphed his feet over time
3) The hyperarch mechanism develops not only glutes but neurologically as a whole.
Therefore, he is able to absorb and distribute a large amount of force in an EFFORTLESS manner. Furthermore, he is not the only one that uses the Hyperarch Mechanism, almost all elite champion class use this mechanism to various degree, examine Lebron James, as his toes are curled and the prominent anterior tibial tendon is pronounced. At the most simple level, sprinting has two components:
* Stride frequency, and
* Stride length. Its a presumed that taller runners aren’t as competitive in the shorter 100 and 200-meter events, due to there length of their legs. Since they lacked the ability for fast turnover, and their stride length couldn’t fully compensate for it. But contradictory to this, most short distance sprinters have most definitely been short. As Bolt has at least the same proportion of fast-twitch to slow-twitch muscle fibers as other elite level sprinters, he is able to achieve a similar turnover as is required. Hence, on adding an almost above-average turnover to some huge stride length, you get the fastest man on the planet as the result.
