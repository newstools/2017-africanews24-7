STORY: Buses left Zimbabwe’s second city, Bulawayo on Friday night (November 17) carrying jubilant supporters of a military seizure seeking to remove President Mugabe from power.People danced and sang songs about the country’s future without Mugabe as they boarded buses.Inside one bus, travellers gestured with their hands to show the snap of a crocodile – nickname of Emerson Mnangagwa, whose sacking last week as vice president sparked the army action. Mugabe, at Zimbabwe’s helm since independence from Britain in 1980, faces the starkest challenge ever to his rule after the army seized power on Wednesday (November 15), saying it was targeting “criminals” around the nonagenarian leader.
