4. (SOUNDBITE) (English) ZIMBABWE PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE SAYING:”Of greater concern (pauses while he finds the next page of the speech) to our commanders are the well-founded fears that the lack of unity and commonness of purpose in both party and government was translating into perceptions of inattentiveness to the economy. Open public spats between high ranking officials in the party and government exacerbated by multiple conflicting messages from both the party and government made the criticisms levelled against us inescapable.”
5. MUGABE MAKING ADDRESS
STORY: Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe on Sunday (November 19) defied his own ZANU-PF party and hundreds of thousands of protesters demanding his resignation by pledging in a television address to preside over the party’s next congress in December.Two sources – one a senior member of the government, the other familiar with talks with leaders of the military – had told Reuters Mugabe would use the address to announce his resignation after ZANU-PF earlier sacked him as its leader in a step precipitated by an army takeover four days earlier. But in the speech from his official residence, sitting alongside a row of generals, Mugabe acknowledged criticisms from ZANU-PF, the military and the public, but made no mention of his own position, instead pledging to preside over the ZANU-PF congress scheduled for next month. ZANU-PF had given the 93-year-old, who led his country to independence in 1980, less than 24 hours to quit as head of state or face impeachment, an attempt to secure a peaceful end to his tenure after a de facto military coup.The leader of Zimbabwe’s liberation war veterans said plans to impeach Mugabe would now go ahead.
