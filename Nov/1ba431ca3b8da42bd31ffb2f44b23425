ZUMA AND BOTSWANA’S PRESIDENT, IAN KHAMA, SHAKING HANDS AFTER MEETING STORY: Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe appeared in public on Friday (November 17) for the first time since the army took charge this week, as the ruling party made plans to force him to step down after more than three decades in power. Mugabe, who is 93, opened a graduation ceremony at Zimbabwe Open University in Harare. He wore blue and yellow academic robes and a mortar board hat and appeared to fall asleep in his chair as his eyes closed and his head lolled. The only words Mugabe spoke at the graduation ceremony were met with ululations from the crowd. Mugabe led the country’s liberation struggle and has dominated its politics since independence in 1980. He said he is still in charge but a senior member of the ZANU-PF ruling party said it wanted him gone. South Africa’s President Jacob Zuma, who had a telephone conversation with Mugabe earlier this week, voiced his concern about the unfolding events in Zimbabwe on Friday. Zuma said he hoped the “political developments” in Zimbabwe would not lead to unconstitutional change of government.
