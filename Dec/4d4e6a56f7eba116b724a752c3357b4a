Karabo Ngoepe JOHANNESBURG- Outgoing African National Congress Secretary General Gwede Mantashe has given advice to the person who will replace him. He says the individual must hit the ground running. In his last official media briefing as an SG, Mantashe was in a jovial mood, talking to ‘his friends’ (Journalists) about what he would do when he steps down. He threw in-jokes as addressed the media, even going as far as ‘Mantashing’ on things. He said he would bring the new SG to meet the media and he would not be bothered by how journalists interact with him. “If any journalist calls me, I will tell them I introduced the news Secretary-General to them,” he said. Turning to more serious issues, Mantashe outlined this for his successor: 1). Remain accessible to members 2). Allow them to shout at you, allow them to insult you and say many things about you but allow them to have access to you. 3). If you are not accessible you will kill the organisation. Don’t prepare to be an institution, you are the SG of the ANC. 4). You must get your feet quickly on the ground and talk to journalists. 5). Others are going to provoke you deliberately, avoid being angry. If they write something that is wrong, pick up the phone and ask them what is this. 6). Engage them, don’t run away from them. Don’t be angry but phone them if they report something that is out of place.
