CAPE TOWN, December 30 (ANA) – Ajax Cape Town on Saturday announced the signing of Zimbabwe international Tendai Ndoro. He has committed his services to the club for the next two seasons after successfully passing his medical, and he has already started training with his new teammates at Ikamva. Ndoro joins the Urban Warriors from Saudi Arabian-outfit Al-Faisaly for an undisclosed fee. He joined Al-Faisaly from Orlando Pirates in August. The forward will add firepower to an Ajax Cape Town outfit eager to climb the Absa Premiership standings, starting with a favourable result against Maritzburg United next week Friday; the first of six league matches for the club in January 2018. The former Mpumalanga Black Aces striker reunites with Muhsin Ertugral in Parow, having previously worked with the Ajax Cape Town head coach in Soweto. Ndoro scored 12 goals in 30 league appearances during the 2016-17 season for the Buccaneers, before moving to the Middle East two games into the ensuing campaign. “Having a player of Tendai’s magnitude and calibre on board for any coach is a massive boost, he is a great player and hopefully he can rise to the occasion,” said Ertugral. “I am very excited to work with him once more, in South Africa he will be a very valuable player to any team and I am confident he will do very well for us. I am very, very pleased to have him at the club and thank you to the club’s management for making this transfer happen. Ertugral continued: “He is the complete package, he has played overseas, performed for big clubs in the past and his experience will be a valuable asset. There are a lot of talented youngsters at the club and Ndoro will help them in reaching their potential. “He [Tendai] is firing on all cylinders and hopefully we can get back to winning ways for our loyal supporters,” Ertugral concluded.
