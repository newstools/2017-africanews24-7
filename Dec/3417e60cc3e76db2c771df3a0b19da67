Hawaii resumed monthly statewide testing of Cold War-era nuclear attack warning sirens on Friday (December 1) for the first time in at least a quarter century, in preparation for a possible missile strike from North Korea. State emergency management authorities said they decided in recent months to reactivate the state’s nuclear attack sirens for the first time since the 1980s after experts deemed some of North Korea’s missiles were capable of reaching Hawaii. Videos uploaded to social media showed the cities of Maui and Honolulu while sirens wailed during a nuclear drill. Governor David Ige said earlier in the week that he believed Hawaii was the first in the nation to reintroduce statewide nuclear siren drills.
