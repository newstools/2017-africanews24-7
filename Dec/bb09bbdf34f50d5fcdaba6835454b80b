Dec 19 – San Francisco-based bitcoin exchange
Coinbase said on Tuesday it would allow customers to buy, sell,
send and receive Bitcoin Cash, a clone of the original
cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Cash was created on Aug. 1 when Hong Kong-based
digital currency exchange Bitfinex said a minority of bitcoin
miners would be “forking” to create a new version of bitcoin to
make trading faster and easier. Coinbase said all customers who held a bitcoin balance on
Coinbase at the time of the fork will now see an equal balance
of Bitcoin Cash available in their Coinbase account. -(Reuters)
