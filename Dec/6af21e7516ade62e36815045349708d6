Karabo Ngoepe JOHANNESBURG – Police in Limpopo have launched a manhunt following the shooting of one of their own by a group of five men in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the five men who were allegedly wearing bulletproof vests shot and injured a police sergeant and they robbed him of his service pistol as well as his cellphone. The officer was shot outside his partner’s house while he was inside fetching a cellphone charger. “The injured member was on patrol duties in Tzaneen, together with his colleague when they decided to drive to a colleague’s house to fetch a cellphone charger. One of them got into the house and whilst inside, he allegedly heard a gunshot sound. When peeping through the window, he allegedly noticed four men wearing police bulletproof vests. The suspects then fled into the nearby bushes, leaving the injured member and the state vehicle behind,” he said. When the other member finally got out of the house to investigate, he found his colleague injured and lying on the ground. Mojapelo said investigations revealed that the suspects committed another crime on the same evening as they made their getaway. “Preliminary investigations revealed that the same suspects were believed to have broken into a house at Medipark in Tzaneen about 30 minutes later, ordered the occupants; husband, his wife and a child at gunpoint to lie on the floor before robbing them of a cellphone and a white Nissan Sentra motor vehicle with registration numbers ADV6067,” he said. Mojapelo added that a Task Team comprising members of the TRT, Crime Intelligence and Detectives has been established to trace the suspects. He called on members of the community to assist police with information that will lead to the arrest of the suspects. @karabongoepe1 karabo.ngoepe@africanews.co.za
