CAIRO, Dec 14 – Egypt’s aviation minister will
travel to Russia on Thursday to sign protocol agreements to
allow the resumption of Russian civilian flights that were
suspended after the 2015 bombing of a tourist jet, two ministry
sources said. Russian President Vladimir Putin met with his counterpart
Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo this week to
discuss resuming flights and to sign a deal for a nuclear power
plant as part of growing bilateral cooperation. Moscow halted civilian air traffic to Egypt in 2015 after
militants detonated a bomb on a Russian Metrojet flight, downing
the jet leaving from the tourist resort of Sharm el-Sheikh and
killing 224 people on board. -(Reuters)
