DURBAN, December 2 (ANA) – Bidvest Wits and Bloemfontein Celtic are both pumped up as the hours tick down to Saturday’s Telkom KO final at the Princess Magogo Stadium in Kwa Mashu, just outside Durban (start 6pm).
Wits defender Buhle Mkhwanazi said on Friday the club needed to redeem themselves because of their bad start to the season.
“Winning this trophy will really give us a confidence-booster as a team and as individuals to say we are still good and can’t be written off just like that. We really need to give our all and push and the results will come our way.”
Wits captain Thulani Hlatshwayo maintains Celtic are favourites.
“Celtic have been doing well. They have a lot of speedy and skilful players and we have to make sure that we bring our A-game on the day.
“Sometimes if you look at the history, teams that are not doing well in the league end up winning trophies. Looking at where we are, it’s easy for them to underestimate us because we have not been doing well in the league. But as a team, we have to make sure we bring silverware.
Meanwhile, Bloemfontein Celtic head coach Veselin Jelušic is determined to do well.
“Of course, it is my ambition to win this cup to repeat the feat of my predecessors,” said Jelušic.
“I’m counting on the high motivation of the players to help win this cup. Cup experience in some players will be very important.”
Celtic striker Jacky Motshegwa admits it is going to be a difficult encounter against Wits.
“We are working hard to win this cup as we did in 2012 and the coach is encouraging us. We’ve worked hard but it is all about teamwork. Our character will be tested in this match.
“Wits are the favourites and we are the underdogs. They have more experienced players than us. They have players in their squad who have tasted what it is like to win the Telkom Knockout and have also won other trophies.” African News Agency (ANA),
