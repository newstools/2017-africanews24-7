PIETERMARITZBURG, December 9 – Maritzburg United thrashed Baroka FC 3-0 in an Absa Premiership match at the Harry Gwala Stadium on Friday night – but more importantly shot six places up the table to fifth spot.
Baroka, on the other hand, slipped down to fourth spot.
Bakgaga dominated possession in the opening stages of the match as they searched for an early goal.
Richard Ofori, the Maritzburg goalkeeper, was called into action in the ninth minute and he made a decent save to deny Baroka winger Mpho Kgaswane.
The Team of Choice also threatened by Mohau Mokate, who forced Baroka keeper Virgil Vries into a good save in the 19th minute.
Vries was then beaten by his former Maritzburg team-mate Evans Rusike 12 minutes later. Rusike scored with a decent finish to make it 1-0 to the hosts.
Bakgaga then applied some pressure on the Team of Choice defence in search of the equalising goal with halftime break fast approaching.
However, Maritzburg contained Baroka as a tightly-contested first half came to an end.
The second half got off to a lively start and the home side managed to extend their lead after Bakgaga’s defence was exposed.
An unmarked Rusike grabbed his second goal of the night to make it 2-0 to Maritzburg seven minutes after the restart.
The match was really put to bed in the 65th minute when Siphesinla Ndlovu scored the third goal. African News Agency (ANA),
