JOHANNESBURG, December 4 – A high-level security conference to discuss a comprehensive approach to security in Somalia, as part of a follow-up to the London Conference on Somalia, held in May this year, was held in the capital Somali Mogadishu on Monday. Somali President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed “Farmaajo” opened the conference which was co-convened by the Somali Government and the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). Attendees included representatives from the Federal Government and federal member states, the AU, UN, European Union and other international partners. High on the agenda of the conference was the implementation of the National Security Architecture plan, which is central to achieving sustainable security reform and a transition of primary responsibility of security from AMISOM to Somali security forces. Also on the agenda was the financing of the Somali security sector and the next steps on AMISOM’s transition. The Special Representative of the Chairperson of the AU Commission (SRCC), for Somalia, Ambassador Francisco Caetano Madeira, said the conference would be critical in reviewing progress made so far, in the security and political fronts, in Somalia. “The success will be measured in terms of what important decisions will be taken to enable AMISOM to undertake effective, robust operations against Al Shabaab, said Madeira. AMISOM’s ability to implement its new mandate, given to it through the a UN security council resolution which will enable it to carry out mop up operations against Al Shabaab, secure main supplies, protect population centres, mentor the Somali forces that support AMISOM, and empower them to be able to take over from AMISOM, were all critical Madeira explained. – African News Agency (ANA)
