ABIDJAN, Dec 4 – Ivory Coast cocoa regions
received little or no rain last week as the dry season took
hold, though downpours earlier this year have helped soil
moisture levels, farmers said on Monday. The dry season in the world’s top cocoa producer runs from
mid-November to March, bringing with it the threat of the
Harmattan winds that carry Saharan sands and can damage crops. But farmers across the cocoa regions were optimistic for a
good crop. “We see the approach of the drought with a lot of sun but
the rains will strengthen the soil moisture and help the trees,”
said Etienne Yao, who farms in the eastern region of Aboisso. Data collected by Reuters showed zero rainfall last week in
Soubre region in the heart of the cocoa belt, 14.7 mm below
average, though some farmers said it had rained in places on
Sunday night. “We are having a very good season. We still need one rain a
week this month so picking is plentiful and the quality is good
next year,” said Lazare Ake, who farms on the outskirts of
Soubre. In the eastern region of Aboisso, which includes Abengourou,
farmers said the weather last week bodes well for the crop. Data
collected by Reuters showed 2.3 mm of rainfall there, 9.9 mm
below average. Data collected by Reuters showed no rain in Daloa, 5.6 mm
below average. Rainfall last week in the southern region of Divo
was at 0.1 millimetres, 11.2 mm below average. Rainfall in the
southern region of Agboville was 2.8 millimetres, 10.8 below
average. No rain was reported last week in the western region of
Daloa, including Bouafle, and farmers said they were waiting for
the Harmattan dry wind. “There is fog in the mornings. This means that Harmattan is
not far away. The peasants are afraid it will be strong,” one
farmer said. -(Reuters)
