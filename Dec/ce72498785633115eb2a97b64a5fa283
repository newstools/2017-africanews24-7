JOHANNESBURG, December 8 – Equity Express Securities Exchange (EESE) said on Friday it had launched operations in South Africa, with Ukhamba Holdings becoming its first listed company.
EESE is the fifth licenced exchange to commence operations in South Africa and was specifically created to target black economic empowerment schemes.
Its first listing, Ukhamba Holdings Proprietary Limited, is the broad-based black economic partner of Imperial Holdings Limited, with a market capitalisation of R340 million.
“As a licenced exchange adhering to the stock exchange directives of the Financial Services Board, we are pleased to now provide Ukhamba with regulatory certainty regarding their share trading activities,” EESE CEO Anthony Wilmot said.
Ukhamba restricts ownership and trading in its shares to South Africans who were disadvantaged during apartheid, the racial system which promoted the interests of minority whites and fell in 1994 when the ruling African National Congress (ANC) came to power. – African News Agency (ANA),
