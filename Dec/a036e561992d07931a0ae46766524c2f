Zodidi Mhlana The City of Johannesburg’s Group Forensic and Investigations Services has launched an investigation following an attempted break – in at Ennerdale clinic during the weekend. MMC for Health and Social Development, Dr Mpho Phalatse in the City said that this failed burglary comes after a computer and a blood pressure machine were recently stolen from the same clinic. Phalatse said that the targeting of public health facilities by criminals in the city was worrying. “It is important that we work together to secure our facilities. We cannot allow acts of criminality to compromise the quality of service to our people. I have reported the attempted break-in to our Group Forensic and Investigations Unit under General Shadrack Sibiya to assist my department in apprehending those involved.” Phalatse said that residents should play an important role in protecting health care facilities. “For the first time in history, the clinics providing services through the extended hours were open during Christmas and public holidays to improve access to universal health care to all individuals and families in our communities,” Phalatse said. The City has called on communities to report “acts of criminality and corruption to law enforcement agencies, including the GFIS Unit.” Phalatse said that security has since been beefed at the clinic.
