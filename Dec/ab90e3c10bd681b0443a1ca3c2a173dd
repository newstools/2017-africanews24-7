Zodidi Mhlana A total of 2247 drivers  were nabbed for being over the alcohol limit with the majority of those arrested in Gauteng during the festive season according to the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC). The Road Traffic Management Corporation spokesperson Simon Zwane said that traffic law enforcement authorities were ready to deal with high volumes of traffic during the weekend. “More than 105 000 drivers were tested for alcohol and 2247 drivers were arrested for having alcohol blood content above the legal limit. The highest number of arrested drunk drivers were in Gauteng, followed by Limpopo, Mpumalanga and the Western Cape. Around the clock law enforcement operations are continuing this weekend and will remain in place until the re-opening of schools,” he said. Zwane said that they were concerned about the number of pedestrians who have been killed since the start of the festive season. “The figure of pedestrians killed is very high and alcohol is one of the contributing factors, “he said.
