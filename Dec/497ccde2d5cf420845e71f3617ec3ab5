British scientists at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) create the world’s smallest Christmas card, so tiny that over 200 million of them could fit into a standard postage stamp. WATCH: This Christmas card is so small that more than 200 million of them could fit on a standard postage stamp. It was created by British scientists at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), and measures 15 x 20 micrometers; a micrometer being one millionth of a metre. It’s made from platinum-coated silicon nitride, and was illustrated using a focused ion beam. At this time of year many of us are hurrying to get our Christmas cards in the post. You could fit 7 quadrillion (7,000,000,000,000,000) of these cards into an average post box – roughly 900,000 for every person on Earth The card’s inventors say tools that created it are used to accurately measure the thickness of extremely small materials, and is helping to unlock new battery and semiconductor technologies.
