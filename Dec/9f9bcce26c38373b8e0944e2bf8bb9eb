JOHANNESBURG, December 4 – Mthokozisi Ndaba, the Idols runner-up, is a relieved man – for now – after the Hillbrow Magistrates Court on Monday refused to put him on trial for allegedly assaulting a 21-year-old woman identified as Neo Tsele, citing the lack of evidence. Mthokozisi, 24, who needed counselling to deal with losing the Idols competition to Paxton Fielies from Cape Town, was nabbed by police on Thursday on suspicion of assaulting the woman in a flat in Braamfontein on 24 November. However, the provisional withdrawal of the charges may result in Mthokozisi’s prosecution if sufficient evidence comes to light. The Idols season 13 runner up was represented by lawyer, James Ndebele, who said the senior prosecutor decided to provisionally withdraw the charges against Ndaba because they “do not have sufficient evidence at their disposal to proceed”. Ndebele said the he has given the state homework to do and they should investigate those  aspects and make a final decision. “With my 15 years experience, it is highly unlikely that they will come back and prosecute we are confident that if the state had prospects of proceeding they would have done so today,” Ndebele said. – African News Agency (ANA)
