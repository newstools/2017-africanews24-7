Accra – Germany plans to assist Ghana in creating better
economic opportunities to discourage illegal migration, German
President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Tuesday during a visit to the
West African nation. “We want to help Ghana to offer its young citizens better
opportunities than the life-threatening journey of illegal
migration,” Steinmeier told journalists in the capital, Accra. It was the mutual obligation of European and African nations to warn
people of the great dangers of the migratory journey towards Europe,
said Steinmeier at the beginning of a four-day visit to Ghana and
Gambia. “We have to fight together against criminal trafficking networks,”
the president said, highlighting the fact that Germany was granting
asylum to those fleeing political persecution and conflict, but not
to economic migrants. Later on Tuesday, Steinmeier, who is travelling with German economic
minister Brigitte Zypries, met with Ghanaian President Nana
Akufo-Addo to discuss bilateral trade relations. “I am completely convinced that [Akufo-Addo] is serious about a more
investment-friendly environment here in Ghana,” said Steinmeier. Germany now needed to come up with ways of increasing the number of
skilled jobs in Ghana, to give citizens reasons to stay in the
region, Steinmeier added. Steinmeier is also scheduled to open a migration advisory centre in
Accra on Wednesday, aimed at training young Ghanaians and supporting
business start-ups. -(dpa)
