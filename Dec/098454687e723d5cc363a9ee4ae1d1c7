JOHANNESBURG, December 20 – Two people were killed and 14 others injured on Wednesday morning after a taxi crashed into the side of a truck approximately 10 km outside Potchefstroom, emergency service ER24 said. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said paramedics and other rescue operators arrived on the scene shortly after 01h00 to find both the truck and taxi on the side of the road. Several passengers from the taxi were walking around the scene. “Paramedics found the bodies of the male taxi driver and female passenger lying trapped inside the taxi,” Meiring said. “Unfortunately, both patients had already succumbed to their numerous injuries.”
He said 14 other patients were found on the scene, three of whom had sustained critical injuries while 11 were minor to moderate. Rescue services had to use specialised rescue tools to free a woman trapped in the rear of the taxi for an hour. She was later airlifted by a private medical helicopter to Lenmed Randfontein. Other patients were transported by ambulance to Potchefstroom Provincial Hospital for further care. – African News Agency (ANA)
