Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- North West police have launched an investigation following a shooting that left six people injured in Rustenburg on Tuesday. Provincial police spokesperson, Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said that protesting residents were injured after security officials fired rubber bullets at them during a protest at a residential complex in the morning. “Cases of public violence and attempted murder have been registered for investigation by the police in Rustenburg. This is after security officials allegedly fired rubber bullets to protesting residents of a residential complex in Rustenburg. At this stage, six persons; five males and a female are reported to have sustained injuries,” he said. Mokgwabone said that it was alleged that Waterkloof Hills Estate residents “blocked the road in the early hours of Tuesday and impeded the buses from leaving the complex to take workers to Rasimone Mine.” A community member who spoke on condition of anonymity told Africa News 24-7 that residents took to the streets concerning incorrect billing on municipal bills. “Residents received letters informing them that they were owing, while they are paying for their services. Those who were injured were taken to hospital.” No arrests have been made at this stage. @Mhlana
