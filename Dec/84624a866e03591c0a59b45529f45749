Karabo Ngoepe JOHANNESBURG- Police have warned South Africans to keep their windows closed over the festive to avoid mosquitoes and robberies. Brooklyn Police Station spokesperson Captain Colette Weilbach said at a recent Tshwane Central Cluster Crime Combatting Forum meeting, crime tendencies were discussed for the seven police stations within the cluster and they picked up on robberies targeting houses with open windows due to the hot weather. “At least two incidents were reported within the Garsfontein and Silverton areas where the house robbers were looking for houses with open windows in security complexes. The complainants reported to the police that they were sleeping with open windows due to the heat.  Major General Botsheleng raised the concern that residents are not safety conscious enough and make themselves vulnerable through their negligence. She used some humour and said that open windows not only give access to mosquitoes but also give access to those mosquitoes with firearms,” said Weilbach. She said the Tshwane Central Cluster South African Police Service (SAPS) would be out in full force this festive season to ensure that communities feel safe but she urged community members to remain alert and not let their guard down. Weilbach said people must be observant at all times, report any suspicious vehicles that are parked in the driveway of a neighbour’s house, especially if the neighbours are away for the holidays. “Develop a habit of locking doors and closing windows, even when you are home. Upgrade security measures at back doors, kitchen windows and sliding doors. Do not leave valuables like laptops and cell-phones near an open window where it is easily accessible from the outside. Panic buttons that are strategic available inside the house can be activated to send out an audible or silent alarm as soon as an intruder or threat is encountered,” she said.
