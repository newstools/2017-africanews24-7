CAPE TOWN, December 20 – A South African magistrate has sentenced a 30-year-old man to life behind bars for the rape and murder of his girlfriend. Nkululeko Siyathemba Monwabisi Ngcekwa received two life sentences, which will however run concurrently. Police spokesperson Captain Xoli Mbele said Ngcekwa had an argument with his girlfriend Zamabuya Nondalo Ngwenya the night before the murder. He said police had on January 4, 2014 received information of a murder, and upon arriving at the venue found Ngwenya, 27, lying half naked on a bed. She had bruises on her neck and a swollen eye and had been strangled and raped. Ngwenya was declared dead on the scene. Ngcekwa handed himself over to police three days after the murder. Mbele welcomed the sentence and appealed to community members to report domestic violence to police “Silence is no longer golden; inform the police when your neighbours are fighting and ask to remain anonymous if need be,” Mbele said. – African News Agency (ANA)
