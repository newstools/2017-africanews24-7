JOHANNESBURG, December 1 (ANA) – The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said on Friday it had signed a three-year wage agreement with Kangra Coal Mine, effectively ending a week-long strike.
In a statement, NUM said the two parties agreed on a R600 wage increase for 2017, and 7 percent rises for the following two years respectively.
They also settled on a R1,000 hike in workers’ housing allowance this year, followed by increases of 12 percent and 14 percent for 2018 and 2019 respectively.
“The strike has come to end. The NUM members are back to work starting with the morning shift today,” said Peter Bailey, NUM chief negotiator in the coal sector.
Last week NUM signed a three-year wage deal with major producers Anglo American Coal SA, Exxaro Coal, Glencore, Msobo Coal, Koornfontein Mines and Delmas Coal, avoiding a looming sector-wide job boycott. The agreement will see wages rise by up to 7.5 percent over the next three years.
Coal remains crucial to electricity production in South Africa, generating about 85 percent of its power.
