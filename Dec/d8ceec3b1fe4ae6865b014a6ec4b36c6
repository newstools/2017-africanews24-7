PORT ELIZABETH, December 14 – A disgraced former member of a police task team that tackles gangs was back in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. Detective constable, Alicia Beeming, who kept mum on the whereabouts of a wanted notorious gangster, who turned out to be her then secret lover, was convicted on a charge of defeating the ends of justice after she pleaded guilty in August. However, the case against Beeming was postponed because state prosecutor, Advocate Jason Thysse, was not available. A probation officer’s report is also yet to be handed in before court. The accused’s lawyer, Hennie Bence, told the court that the defence would not lead evidence at her sentencing proceedings, which is now expected to take place next year. After being subjected to an internal discipline hearing in November last year, Beeming was sent back to her station of origin, the Motherwell Police Station, where she works within the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences (FCS) unit. Beeming was found guilty in the internal discipline hearing and had to pay a fine of R2,400. She was also given a sanction of dismissal that was suspended for six months on condition that she is not guilty of similar misconduct. The detective constable landed herself in hot water when she kept mum about her personal relationship with gang member, Hans Jordaan, all the while she was an active specialist investigator probing gang activity in Port Elizabeth’s northern areas. Beeming had access to both covert and overt intelligence, as well as case dockets investigated by the Gang Task Team unit, all privileged information. She had information on the whereabouts of Jordaan, but kept silent about it while her unit was searching for him in connection with an attempted murder charge related to a gang shooting in 2014. The case was postponed to January 26 next year. – African News Agency (ANA)
