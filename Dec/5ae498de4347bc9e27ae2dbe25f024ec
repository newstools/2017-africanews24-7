Karabo Ngoepe JOHANNESBURG- The Progressive Professionals Forum (PPF) has welcomed the ANC’s pro-black policies that were adopted during the recent elective conference. Spokesperson Phapano Phasha said the policies were a sign that the ruling party was ready to transform the country. “Under the leadership of the new ANC President, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the new leadership collective excitedly represents a team that is well aware of the critical task ahead, for that we thank the wisdom of the delegates who elected them,” she said. “What is even more critical is the resolutions taken by this conference, which demonstrates an ANC committed and determined to truly and genuinely transform South Africa.” The party announced that it would be pushing to change the Constitution to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation. The PPF has welcomed the move and said such policies raised confidence. “The radical resolutions such as Expropriation of land without compensation, nationalization of the South African Reserve Bank, free Education and as well as the formation of the statement bank through the immediate awarding commercial license to the South African Post Office, amongst others, undoubtedly brings confidence to all South Africans and professionals in particular that the ANC is not only serious about transformation but it remains the only genuine vehicle for the aspirations and inspirations of all South Africans,” she said. Phasha added that through such resolutions and their implementation, the colonial-apartheid patterns of socioeconomic development can be disrupted to allow for the building of a broader and inclusive economy for the benefit of all. “To that end, PPF will continue to work with the new leadership and President Ramaphosa in ensuring that as professionals, we continue to bring our expertise to the building of a better and caring South Africa under the ANC leadership,” she said.
