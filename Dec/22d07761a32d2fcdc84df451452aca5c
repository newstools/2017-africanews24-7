Karabo Ngoepe JOHANNESBURG – The High Court in Pretoria has declared the appointment of Shaun Abrahams as the National Director of Public Prosecutions unlawful and said the decision must be set aside. The full bench of the North Gauteng High Court made the ruling on Friday morning and also ruled that his predecessor Mxolosi Nxasana’s resignation was fuelled by promises of unlawful rewards. He claimed he was pushed and was given a R17 Million golden handshake which the court also ruled that he was not entitled to it and he should pay it back. Gauteng Judge President Dunstan Mlambo, however, said it would not be just to reinstate Nxasana to his former position. Mlambo further ruled that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa must appoint a new NDPP in the next 60 days. That power lies with the President but Mlambo said President Jacob Zuma was conflicted on the matter and therefore he should not make the appointment. Zuma has a pending case to reinstate charges against him. Abrahams was supposed to make an announcement on Friday regarding the progress of the case.
