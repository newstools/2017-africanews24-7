JOHANNESBURG, December 16 – The African National Congress (ANC) national conference was delayed on Saturday as the party top brass held a national executive committee meeting in the wake of several court rulings made on Friday. The opening of the conference was supposed to start at 9am when President Jacob Zuma would deliver his last speech as party leader, but Friday’s court rulings, which came after objections by disgruntled party members in the build up to the national conference, has meant a delayed start to proceedings. Meanwhile, delegates arrived in buses and cars at the Nasrec Expo Centre in Johannesburg for the much anticipated 54th national elective conference, from which a new leader will emerge to succeed Jacob Zuma as party president. Delegates sang as they made their way to the conference venue, with a number expressing their support for Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and Cyril Ramaphosa, the leading candidates for the ANC presidency. ANC deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa, national chairperson Baleka Mbete, treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize, their fellow national executive committee members Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Lindiwe Sisulu, Jeff Radebe, and Matthews Phosa, are all contenders for the position of the party’s president. – African News Agency (ANA)
