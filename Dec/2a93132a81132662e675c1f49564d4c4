BRUSSELS, Dec 7 – Jerusalem must be the capital of
both Israel and a future Palestinian state, the EU’s foreign
policy chief said on Thursday in response to U.S. President
Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. “The European Union has a clear and united position. We
believe the only realistic solution to the conflict between
Israel and Palestine is based on two states and with Jerusalem
as the capital of both,” EU foreign policy chief Federica
Mogherini told a news conference. Mogherini said she would meet Jordan’s foreign minister on
Friday, while she and EU foreign ministers would discuss
Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in
Brussels on Monday. -(Reuters)
