London – Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho was involved
in a skirmish with Manchester City players following Sunday’s derby
loss, UK media reported. Mourinho reportedly took exception with the way City players
celebrated the 2-1 win at Old Trafford which that took them 11 points
clear of second-place United, the Guardian reported on Monday. According to the newspaper, players and staff from both clubs had to
be separated by police and stewards in the narrow corridor outside
the City dressing room. The row escalated after Mourinho told the victors to turn their music
down and to show more respect to the losing side. Bottles and punches were thrown during and City assistant Mikel
Arteta was left with blood streaming down his face from a split
eyebrow, according to the Guardian. The United boss reportedly also became involved in an argument with
City’s Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson, with the two shouting at each
other in Portuguese. Mourinho then went on to do his post-match media work without mention
of the incident, the Guardian said. -(dpa)
