Karabo Ngoepe JOHANNESBURG- Former ANC President Jacob Zuma has congratulated the new party leadership on its election and reminded those elected that they represent the aspirations of members. “I wish to heartily congratulate Comrade President Cyril Ramaphosa for his election to lead this giant movement of our people, the African National Congress. With Comrade President Ramaphosa and his leadership collective, lies the aspirations of our people in South Africa, the region and the continent, the majority of whom are black and poor. We therefore wish the leadership collective all the best in taking our country forward through the policies and programmes of the ANC,” said Zuma. The National Conference also elected as Officials, David Mabuza as Deputy President, Gwede Mantashe as National Chairperson, Ace Magashule as Secretary-General, Jessie Duarte as Deputy Secretary-General and Paul Mashatile as the Treasurer-General. Zuma praised delegates for setting aside factionalism and politics of the slate to unite the movement. The top six consists of three members from each faction. “There was no winner or loser in the election of leaders but the ANC was the clear winner. The delegates have shown yet again that there is no task bigger than the ANC. But most importantly, they have demonstrated that the unity of the ANC is sacrosanct. I am also certain that the policies as adopted by the conference will lead South African to prosperity through the programme of Radical Socio-Economic Transformation and a renewed onslaught on the challenges of poverty, unemployment and inequality,” said  Zuma.
